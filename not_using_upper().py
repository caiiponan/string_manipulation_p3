# Let user input a string
# Initialize an empty string 'uppercase_text' to store the result.
# Loop through each character in user input.
# If the character is a lowercase letter (between 'a' and 'z'):
#    Convert it to uppercase by subtracting 32 from its ASCII value.
#    Append the converted character to 'uppercase_text'.
# If the character is not a lowercase letter:
#    Append it to 'uppercase_text' as it is.
# Print the original and uppercase converted strings.
